D - Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. In addition to this, they both must depend on abstractions.
For this example, BasicCalculator is a class that is high-level and where we perform all crucial events. On the other
hand, LogKeeper is a class that is low-level and where we perform only needed events.
